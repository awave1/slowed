## About The Project

"slowed" is a simple audio player that plays songs with slowed & reverb effect. This style is heavily based on [Chopped and Screwed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopped_and_screwed) genre of Hip-Hop. Some examples of slowed & reverb remixes:

- [Miles Wesley - Lil Mama (feat. Trevor Daniel)](https://youtu.be/ORzczlbbZSc) (shout out [lunar sky](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqi9XdZm7sxjvMUQ0RRr2Sw))
- [Don Toliver- No idea (s l o w e d + r e v e r b)](https://youtu.be/7g1w53qxNzM)
- ...and many more others
